Bugs / missing features
=======================

* Deletes are currently not working. They are getting correctly replicated to the client,
  but when we pass the Kafka producer a message with a null payload (signifying deletion),
  it goes into a loop of "Broker transport failure" errors. Perhaps an issue with the
  Kafka client library, need to look into it.
* Need to acknowledge message receipt to Postgres only after we've confirmed that it has
  successfully been written to Kafka. (At the moment we're immediately acknowledging to
  Postgres, which risks data loss on crash.) The facility for doing this is there, it's
  just not wired up yet.
* If taking the snapshot fails, we should automatically delete replication slot, so that
  re-running the program tries taking a snapshot again.
* Backpressure in case data from Postgres comes in faster than we can publish it to Kafka.
* Better support for more Postgres datatypes (see oid2avro.c).
* Record fields in autogenerated Avro schemas should default to null, so that adding
  and dropping columns is forward/backward compatible. (This may require patching libavro,
  as I think it doesn't support defaults at the moment.)
* JNI bindings, and/or other programming language support?
